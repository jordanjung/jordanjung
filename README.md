# Hello, I’m Jordan 👋

I'm a product designer, illustrator, and engineer based in Atlanta. I currently work as a UX Director at AKQA and lead DesignOps for Chick-fil-A, where I implement scalable design systems across multiple platforms.

Prior to AKQA, I was a contractor at Unfold where I designed digital products for clients like Merck and YogaJoint. I have also held engineering roles at several companies, including ShootProof, TripLingo, and HP.

Aside from my work, I enjoy traveling — both domestic and international. When I'm not traveling, you can find me trying out new restaurants in Atlanta, knocking down pins at my local bowling alley, and curating my ever-growing sneaker collection.
