# Hello, Iâ€™m Jordan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a former front-end engineer turned product designer. When I'm not buried in pixels, you can find me eating my way through Atlanta and collecting the rarest and ugliest sneakers known to man.

- Retweeting NBA memes on <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanjung">twitter</a>
